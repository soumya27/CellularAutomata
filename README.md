# CellularAutomata 
This projects demonstrates 2D Cellular Automata Crystal Growth 

CACrystal : which holds a 2D Array of cells
CACell : helper class which defines the state of cells
CARule : which can assigns a new cell based on a prior crystal
CACrystalSet : holds multiple CACrystals and can call the CARule class repeatedly to generate a new crystal state


User Interface application : 
Selection field to choose an available Rules 
Input field to specify the maximum number of duration of the CA lifetime 
Start and Stop button to control the simulation 
Graphical display panel to display the results of CA Crystal Growth simulation
